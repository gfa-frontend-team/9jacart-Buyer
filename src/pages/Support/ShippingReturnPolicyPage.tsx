              At 9jacart.ng, we are committed to providing a seamless, reliable, and customer-centric
              shipping and return experience that aligns with global best practices, including those outlined
              by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Federal Competition and
              Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) in Nigeria. Our policy ensures transparency,
              efficiency, and fairness, while integrating seamlessly with our Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
              services to minimize financial strain on customers. This policy applies to all purchases made
              through our platform, including those by diaspora users, and is designed to exceed industry
              standards by offering extended timelines, minimal fees, and proactive support.

                    We partner with a reputable logistics provider — United Parcel Services (UPS) — and local
                    couriers to ensure fast and reliable delivery across Nigeria and to select international
                    destinations for diaspora customers. Delivery timelines are:

                    <li><strong>Other major cities</strong> (e.g., Abuja, Port Harcourt): 2–7 business days for non-perishable products and 48 hours for perishable goods from the date of delivery of goods by vendor.</li>

                    Estimated delivery dates are provided at checkout and via email/SMS notifications.
                    Real-time tracking is available through our user dashboard and app.

                  <p>
                    Orders are processed within 24 hours subject to vendor's confirmation.
                    For BNPL purchases, shipping commences only after credit approval, which typically occurs
                    instantly or within 1 hour. If delays occur due to stock verification or high demand, customers
                    are notified immediately, and alternative options (e.g., similar products) are offered without charge.

                    All shipping fees are clearly displayed at checkout. For diaspora orders, customers are responsible
                    for any applicable customs duties, taxes, or import fees, which are estimated upfront. We provide
                    documentation assistance to facilitate smooth customs processing.

                    Returns are accepted for most items within 30 days of delivery (exceeding the standard 14–15 days
                    in many global policies), provided the item is unused, in original packaging, and with all
                    tags/accessories intact. Exceptions include:

                  <p>
                    For BNPL purchases, returns trigger an automatic adjustment to your payment plan. Full returns
                    result in a complete reversal of the loan balance, with any paid installments refunded to your
                    original payment method or credited toward future purchases. Partial returns adjust the
                    outstanding balance proportionally. Payments are paused during the return process to avoid undue charges.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Refunds for Returns</h3>
                  <p>
                    Refunds are issued within 7 business days of vendor's confirmation via the original payment method.
                    No restocking fees apply unless the return is due to customer error (e.g., change of mind), in which
                    case a 15% fee may be deducted.
