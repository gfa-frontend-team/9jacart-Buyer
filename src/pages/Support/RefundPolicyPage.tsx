              9jacart.ng's Cancellation and Refund Policy is crafted to embody global best practices,
              drawing from frameworks like the EU Consumer Rights Directive and Nigeria's FCCPC
              guidelines, ensuring maximum flexibility, transparency, and protection for customers. This
              policy integrates BNPL features to allow cancellations without financial penalties where
              possible, promoting trust and accessibility for all users, including those in the diaspora.

                  <p>
                    Orders can be canceled free of charge at any time before shipping (within 30 minutes of
                    placement). For BNPL orders, this results in immediate loan cancellation with no impact
                    on your credit profile.

                    Cancellation of orders of non-perishable goods are subject to the policy of the vendor. If
                    an order has shipped but not yet delivered, cancellations are subject to the policy of the
                    vendor provided the goods are non-perishable. Once delivered, cancellations transition
                    to our Return Policy (see Shipping and Return Policy).

                    Refunds are issued to the original payment method (PayStack). Refunds are issued by the

                    Refunds for defective items are prioritized within 48 hours. No refunds for used/non-returnable
                    items unless faulty. In cases of force majeure (e.g., natural disasters), refunds may be delayed
                    but communicated promptly.

                    If a dispute (see Dispute Policy) results in a favorable outcome, refunds are expedited with
                    potential compensation for inconvenience (e.g., 10% bonus credit).
